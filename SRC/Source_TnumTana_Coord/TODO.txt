TO BE DONE in Tnum / Tana:

A) Tana

- change the MCTDH variable names for polyshperical coord (Tana and Tnum)

- change the Get_F2_F1_FROM_TWOxKEO:
    => make the expansion of the KEO (whatever its form is)

- Correct the bug with subsystem and new spherical convention

- Implement the overloading operators for the sum_OpnD

B) Tnum
IRC: project s on the other coordinates.
=> use dX/dq^i ???
